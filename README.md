# Weather Telling App

Web app created with node.js to retrieve weather information about the location entered.

The application is ready to deploy and was created as a part on tutorial while getting to know node a little better.

Application can be accessed at [this link](https://verma21296-weather-app.herokuapp.com/ "this link") if I haven't scaled dynos to 0 or the app didn't went idle and got shut down by heroku.
